    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">WhatTheBug · Last updated: February 2025</p>

    <p>WhatTheBug (&quot;the App&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Photos you capture:</strong> When you take a photo of an insect to identify it, that image is sent to our analysis service (powered by OpenAI) to provide you with identification and information. Images are processed for this purpose only and are not used to train AI models.</p>
    <p><strong>Local storage:</strong> The App stores your captured insect photos and analysis results on your device. This data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers beyond the one-time analysis request.</p>
    <p><strong>Purchase data:</strong> In-app purchases are handled by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. We only receive information necessary to verify your subscription or purchase status (e.g., whether you have access to premium features).</p>

    <h2>2. Camera Access</h2>
    <p>The App requests camera access solely to let you capture photos of insects for identification. Camera access is used only when you choose to take a photo. We do not access your camera in the background.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Images you submit for analysis are sent to OpenAI for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for how they handle data.</p>
    <p><strong>Apple:</strong> In-app purchases, subscriptions, and App Store analytics are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or location. We do not use third-party analytics or tracking in the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your captured insects and analysis results are stored locally on your device. You can delete them at any time from within the App. We do not retain copies of images sent for analysis after the response is delivered.</p>

    <h2>6. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top reflects the most recent revision.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
